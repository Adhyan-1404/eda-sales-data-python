<h2><a class="anchor" id="overview"></a>Overview</h2>

This project performs Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) focused on cleaning and preprocessing a raw sales dataset (`k_circle_sales.csv`) sourced from Kaggle. 
The primary goal is to transform raw, messy sales data into a consistent, structured, and machine-learning-ready format. 
This preparation ensures high data quality for downstream predictive modeling and analysis.

---

<h2><a class="anchor" id="objectives"></a>Objectives</h2>

- Clean and preprocess raw sales data to ensure accuracy and consistency.
- Perform exploratory data analysis to identify patterns, trends, and anomalies.
- Engineer features relevant for future predictive modeling.
- Detect and treat outliers to improve data quality.
- Prepare the dataset to be machine-learning ready for advanced analysis.

<h2><a class="anchor" id="tools--technologies"></a>Tools & Technologies</h2>

1. Python (core language) with key libraries :
   - NumPy (numerical computing)
   - Pandas (data manipulation)
   - Matplotlib and Seaborn (visualization)
   - Warnings module (to manage runtime warnings)

2. IDEs :
   - Jupyter Notebook
   - VScode

<h2><a class="anchor" id="key-steps-performed"></a>Key Steps Performed</h2>

- Handling and imputing **Missing Values** to ensure dataset completeness.
- **Feature Engineering** to create meaningful variables for machine learning models
- **Detecting** and **Treating Outliers** to improve data robustness
- **Correcting incorrect** or **Inconsistent Values** (e.g., negative sales, invalid dates)
- Generating **Summary Statistics** for data validation
- Reducing **Skewness** and applying **Transformations** to approximate **Normality**, optimizing model performance

These steps were accomplished using a combination of data transformations, imputation techniques, and visualizations to get a comprehensive understanding of the dataset.

<h2><a class="anchor" id="notes"></a>Notes</h2>

- Data cleaning and preprocessing were performed entirely in Python using related libraries.
- Visualizations and insights aim to support strategic decision-making and predictive model development.
- The notebook environment (Jupyter/Colab) facilitates interactive exploration and reproducibility.

<h2><a class="anchor" id="how-to-run-this-project"></a>How to Run This Project</h2>

Make sure to update the **file path** for `k_circle_sales.csv` in the notebook **EDA on Sales Data.ipynb** to match your local directory. Failing to do so will result in a **error**. Also make sure all the necessary **Python libraries** mentioned in [Tools & Technologies](#tools--technologies) are already installed.

You can run the notebook directly in Jupyter or use an online service like [Google Colab](https://colab.research.google.com) by uploading the notebook file.

<h2><a class="anchor" id="final-recommendations"></a>Final Recommendations</h2>

- Use the clean and validated dataset as the foundation for future predictive modeling projects.
- Continuously update and validate data preprocessing as new data becomes available.
- Plan for advanced modeling by addressing highlighted data quality or feature engineering gaps.
