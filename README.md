# Overview of EDA on Sales Data

In this project, I performed **Exploratory Data Analysis ( EDA )** on a sales dataset (`k_circle_sales.csv`) sourced from Kaggle using popular Python libraries:

* **NumPy**
* **Pandas**
* **Matplotlib**
* **Seaborn**

**Note:** The `warnings` module in Python is used to manage and suppress warning messages during execution.

### Key Steps Performed :

* Handling **Missing Values**
* **Feature Engineering**
* **Outlier Treatment**
* **Correction of Incorrect Values**
* **Summary Statistics Generation**
* Reducing **Skewness** and transforming data to approximate **normality**

These steps were accomplished using a combination of data transformations, imputation techniques, and visualizations to get a comprehensive understanding of the dataset.

**Important :** Make sure to update the **file path** for `k_circle_sales.csv` in the notebook **EDA on Sales Data.ipynb** to match your local directory. Failing to do so will result in a file-not-found error.
